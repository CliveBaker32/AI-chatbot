# Considerations

I can build A ChatService class to handle the chat history you not deal with inconsistencies in the different data types.\
Specifically leaning towards the purposeful error I get with the response.text in the api.service.ts.\
Also the need the make a new member for the app.component.ts class and deal with the unending changing data types of the chatHistory variable.\
This abstraction is not needed but it does make life a lot easier if I was to improve this project.
